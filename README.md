[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/LoicGrobol/scorch.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/LoicGrobol/scorch)

This is an alternative implementation of the coreference scorer for the CoNLL-2011/2012 shared tasks on coreference resolution.

It aims to be more straightforward than the [reference implementation][ref-scorer], while maintaining as much compatibility with it as possible.

The implementations of the various scores are as close as possible from the formulas used by <a href="#pradhan2014scoring">Pradhan et al. (2014)</a>, with the edge cases for BLANC taken from <a href="recasens2011BLANC">Recasens and Hovy (2011)</a>.

## Use
Download from master with
```bash
git clone https://github.com/LoicGrobol/scorch.git
```

Install with
```bash
python3 -m pip install .
```

Then just use `scorch`, e.g.
```bash
scorch gold.json sys.json out.txt
```

Alternatively, just running `scorch.py` without installing should work as long as you have all the dependencies installed
```
python3 scorch.py -h
```

## Formats
### Single document
The input files should be JSON files with a `"type"` key at top-level

  - If `"type"` is `"graph"`, then top-level should have at top-level
     - A `"mentions"` key containing a list of all mention identifiers
     - A `"links"` key containing a list of pairs of corefering mention identifiers
  - If `"type"` is `"clusters"`, then top-level should have a `"clusters"` key containing a mapping
    from clusters ids to cluster contents (as lists of mention identifiers).

Of course the system and gold files should use the same set of mention identifiers…

### Multiple documents
If the inputs to directories, files with the same base name (excluding extension) as those present
in the gold directory are expected to be present in the sys directory, with exactly one sys file for
each gold file.
In that case, the output scores will be the micro-average of the individual files scores, ie their
arithmetic means weighted by the relative numbers of

  - Gold mentions for Recall
  - System mentions for Precision
  - The sum of the previous two for F₁

This is different from the reference interpretation where

  - **MUC** weighting ignores mentions in singleton entities
    - This should not make any difference for the CoNLL-2012 dataset, since singleton entities are not annotated.
    - For datasets with singletons, the shortcomings of MUC are well known, so this score
     shouldn't matter much
  - **BLANC** is calculated by micro-averaging coreference and non-coreference separately, using
    the number of links as weights instead of the number of mentions.

The CoNLL average score is the arithmetic mean of the global MUC, B³ and CEAFₑ F₁ scores.

  - The version of the Kuhn-Munkres algorithm used for the CEAF scores uses [scipy.optimize.linear_sum_assignment](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/latest/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.linear_sum_assignment.html), with $-ϕ_n$ as cost function.
